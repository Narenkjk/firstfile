      I'm a 19 year old boy ,student at Psgcas.i have taken a new field of study for my Undergrad related to Computer Application.
      I have been wasting my time and hoping i would study the programming languages and take some initiative on improving myself
      for the future, while i haven't moved even a bit towards achieve my goal this is my first attempt towards what i want for
      my future well being.<br/>

      I'm 20 years old now, final year student at PSGCAS. We'll i messed up my undergrad yea i know, in order to make it worse I'm on
      a mission to create more new memories now. stuck messed up real bad , like really really bad. Well abt the wasting time part
      there ain't enough time to waste. Studies trying to make a part up in them but can't concentrate much, pretty lazy ass i would
      say.Got 3 job offers, became the chairman of my department, still in search of my intrests in stuff, my indecisive nature has
      brought in some extra problems and goodness while it's future cannot be determined currently its all on me and my character for
      sure. we'll i lie a lot as usual. Wanna talk less to people but can't help sometimes i just talk a lot. Wanna achieve a lot earn
      a lot , live life to the happiest where i got to know that money plays a lot more than we can even think of . i wanna live in peace
      but guesss i dont deserve it .Need to find a goal or skill in order to amke a living .topg:).

      I'm 22 years old now, let me recap fast after 20 years old, After college travelled a bit was unsure on what to do and later on chose 
      something perfect for life as well as skill. Did pretty well in both untill fumbled in one. Later was quite distracted and idiotic with uncertainity 
      impatience after which i got a job at 3/24. GRANT THORNTON, still when i say the name people don't know but i think it's a good company. Left 
      to a new place, i had a wavering and fearful mindset even after coming here said shit as Love Everyone but doesn't work, they dont. I perform good at work,
      learning and making some friends at work good people C4whole indeed, but life wise i aint so good went on wfh realised a lot. Opened my mind in a big way, i still do miss and think of SW but i fumbled i know and 
      i hate that part yk. I realised very much, Too many goodbyes by the time i am 22. Understood why and what has been happening, yup it was because of me. 
      I aint gonna be like that anymore. Now to present , I am 22 Years Old . I make a very little money , got to know how much i am underpaid did trigger me a bit but 
      yea have to figure out something. I still live in a different town. I understand very little of what people talk. Aint got too many people here. actually bit alone 
      while i wish for more. I can survive outside, mind is set and craving but control is persistent. Work i got lot more to learn. lot more to travel ad lot more to 
      create. Naren, you dont wish for stuff you make it. daddy and shad but be nervous now ig. So 23 year old me, I am kind and Trusting people now , world is cruel but 
      i still smile and trying to be kinder. Start somewhere boi be happy , get people, do whatever you planned , push push ,  get the one 
      decided on what you wanna do ,Take Care of People , Take Care . Even if tired recover and push push you can ma man.
