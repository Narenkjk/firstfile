      I'm a 19 year old boy ,student at Psgcas.i have taken a new field of study for my Undergrad related to Computer Application.
      I have been wasting my time and hoping i would study the programming languages and take some initiative on improving myself
      for the future, while i haven't moved even a bit towards achieve my goal this is my first attempt towards what i want for
      my future well being.<br/>

      I'm 20 years old now, final year student at PSGCAS. We'll i messed up my undergrad yea i know, in order to make it worse I'm on
      a mission to create more new memories now. stuck messed up real bad , like really really bad. Well abt the wasting time part
      there ain't enough time to waste. Studies trying to make a part up in them but can't concentrate much, pretty lazy ass i would
      say.Got 3 job offers, became the chairman of my department, still in search of my intrests in stuff, my indecisive nature has
      brought in some extra problems and goodness while it's future cannot be determined currently its all on me and my character for
      sure. we'll i lie a lot as usual. Wanna talk less to people but can't help sometimes i just talk a lot. Wanna achieve a lot earn
      a lot , live life to the happiest where i got to know that money plays a lot more than we can even think of . i wanna live in peace
      but guesss i dont deserve it .Need to find a goal or skill in order to amke a living .topg:).
